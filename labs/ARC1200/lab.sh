# STEP 0: Thiết lập biến chung
# ===============================
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

echo "🌎 Region: $REGION"

# ===============================
# STEP 1: Tạo PRIVATE bucket
# ===============================
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$PRIVATE_BUCKET \
  --location=$REGION \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access

# Kiểm tra quyền (không có allUsers)
gsutil iam get gs://$PRIVATE_BUCKET

# ===============================
# STEP 2: Tạo PUBLIC bucket
# ===============================
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$PUBLIC_BUCKET \
  --location=$REGION \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access

# Thêm quyền public đọc object
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://$PUBLIC_BUCKET

# Kiểm tra quyền public
gsutil iam get gs://$PUBLIC_BUCKET

# ===============================
# STEP 3: Upload file test (tuỳ chọn)
# ===============================
echo "Hello Qwiklabs!" > test.txt
gsutil cp test.txt gs://$PUBLIC_BUCKET

# ===============================
# STEP 4: Lấy URL public của file
# ===============================
echo "✅ Public URL:"
echo "https://storage.googleapis.com/$PUBLIC_BUCKET/test.txt"
