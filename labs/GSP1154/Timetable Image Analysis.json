Next, I'm shifting focus to a detailed description of the board's visual components, to get a clearer picture of what's presented.\n\n\n**Decoding the Board**\n\nI'm cross-referencing the transcribed text with the provided OCR output. My focus is error correction and a fully accurate representation of the flight information. I'm also verifying the OCR's performance against the image's visual elements.\n\n\n**Composing the List**\n\nI'm now meticulously creating the time and city list, based on my accurate transcription. I'll make a direct comparison with the OCR output. I'll correct any errors present. The \"Time\" and \"City\" columns are the final key step in presenting the flight information properly.\n\n\n",
