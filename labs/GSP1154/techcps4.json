For example:\n\n* **When did it start slowing down?**  (Recently, after an update, gradually over time, etc.)\n* **What are you doing when it's slow?** (General browsing, specific programs, gaming, etc.)\n* **What kind of computer do you have?** (Desktop, laptop, make/model if you know it)\n* **How old is your computer?**\n* **What operating system are you using?** (Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS, etc.)\n\nThe more details you can provide, the better I can help!  In the meantime, you can try a few basic things:\n\n* **Restart your computer:**  This often clears up minor software glitches.\n* **Close unnecessary programs:** Check your Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc in Windows) or Activity Monitor (Command+Space, type Activity Monitor on Mac) to see which programs are using the most resources.\n* **Check your internet connection:** A slow internet connection can make everything feel slow.  Try running a speed test.\n\n\nLet me know how these steps go, and tell me more about the slowness you're experiencing."
